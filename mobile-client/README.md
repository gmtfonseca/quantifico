## Architecture

For this project I've used the [BloC pattern](https://www.didierboelens.com/2018/08/reactive-programming-streams-bloc/) and the library [flutter_bloc](https://pub.dev/packages/flutter_bloc) which helps to implement it. I strongly recommend to read about it before diving into the code.
